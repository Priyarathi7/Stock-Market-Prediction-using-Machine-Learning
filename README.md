Prediction of stock market prices is done using Multilayer perceptron and Random Forest

Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning
Our objective is to predict the stock price using Machine Learning Algorithms.Here,we have used MulitLayer Perceptron and Random Forest for predicting stock.

Software Requirements:
Anaconda Navigator or Jupyter Notebook

Dataset used:
You can download the file which we have used from kaggle.com


This repository contains basically five files which are as follows:
1)StockPredictor.py
2)GOOGL_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv
3)Graph_1
4)Graph_2
5)Graph_3

Description of each file:
1) StockPredictor.py:This file consists of the python code for stock market prediction.We have used inbuilt libraries in python like matpotlib,pandas,numpy,etc.

2) GOOGL_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv: This file basically contains seven columns namely date,open,high,low,close,volume and name of company.Here in this case google is the only company we have used.
  Open refers to the time at which people can begin trading on a particular exchange.
  Low is the opposite of high. It represents a lower price point for a stock or index.
  High refers to a market milestone in which a stock or index reaches a greater price point than previously for a particular time period.
  Close simply refers to the time at which a stock exchange closes to trading.
  Volume refers to the number of shares of stock traded during a particular time period, normally measured in average daily trading volume
  
 3) Graph_1:This is the test data which we have used.
 
 4) Graph_2:This is the graph of actual versus predicted using Multilayer Perceptron.
 
 5) Graph_3:This the graph of actual versus predicted using Random Forest.
